<p>We all want to increase the value of our properties and there are many ways that you can achieve this. One of the easiest and most effective ways is through having a good quality garage door as this can take up approximately 40% of your homes facade, therefore, making a huge impression on the outside world. There is little surprise then that this can play a significant part in the valuation of your home. Here are three ways that both you and your home could benefit from a good quality garage door.</p>

<h2>1. Curb Appeal</h2>
<p>If you are thinking about selling your property you will naturally want to increase its curb appeal to potential buyers. How your property appears will play a massive part in its value and as we have established, a massive part of the outside of your property is taken up by the garage door. Initially, you could focus on the colours, something that matches with your homes existing colour scheme such as windows, doors and even the brickwork. If you are feeling brave, you could opt for bolder colours to truly make a statement. It has been proven time and again that prospective buyers are heavily influenced by a home's exterior.

<h2>2. Energy Savings</h2>
<p>Improving the insulation of your property can add up to 4% on to the value. In addition, you will save money on your monthly bills by keeping the internal temperature of your property constant. You may be astonished to hear that a poorly insulated garage can lead to massive changes in the temperature of your property as generally the two are connected. A quality installation company will address this ensuring that you increase the value of your property. Recent surveys have suggested that in addition to the immediate 4% increase in value, the savings on bills alone can make a double digit increase on your bottom line.</p>
<h2>3. Safety and Security</h2>
<p>It is perfectly natural that we want to keep our properties safe and secure. All modern garage doors that are supplied by a reputable manufacturer will have this very much at forefront of their design. On top of this, sensors will also protect your other property from being damaged by the door accidentally closing when there is an obstruction in the way. Intruders will also be kept very much at bay by the superb locking systems that are now available. Not only will this add value to your property but it will also keep your loved ones safe.</p>
<p>It is only natural that you will only want to add the finest additions to your property. It is therefore wise to shop around and look for the best manufacturers and suppliers available.
